1)time_to_seconds(time_str):
Converts a time string in the format hh:mm:ss into the total number of seconds.
It splits the input string into hours, minutes, and seconds, then converts them to seconds and returns the total.

2)__init__(self):

It applies styling (CSS-like) for the UI to improve appearance.

4)validate_time_input(self, time_str):
Validates whether the time string provided is in the correct hh:mm:ss format.
It uses a regular expression to check the format and ensures the hours, minutes, and seconds are within valid ranges.

5)process_video(self):
Handles the logic for processing the video.
It retrieves the YouTube URL and start/end times from the user input, validates them, and then proceeds to download and cut the video audio using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.
If any errors occur (e.g., invalid input or file issues), it shows appropriate error messages.
The audio is extracted from the video, and a specific segment (based on the user-defined start and end times) is saved as an MP3 file.

Each function is aimed at providing a smooth workflow for extracting and cutting audio from a YouTube video based on user-defined timestamps.
